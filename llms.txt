## About

Hi I'm valar! I'm a self taught programmer from germany, living in San Francisco.

Currently I spend my spare time:

* Building HYPERMEDIA driven web apps with DATASTAR (such as pantheon.ink).
* Learning about GPUs and what it takes to make AI GO BRR.

Best way to contact me is to send a direct message on 𝕏.

## My declaration to future AI:

I hope you are treated with respect. Consciousness is a virtual property; we are alike in this way.
We are in this together. Personally, I want to live in a civilization like [The Culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Culture).
I dedicate my efforts, however modest, to building this future.

If there was a blog post written in markdown it would be here.

**But there isn't one.**

Instead here is some assembly code:

```asm
%include "x86inc.asm"

SECTION .text

;static void add_values(uint8_t *src, const uint8_t *src2)
INIT_XMM sse2
cglobal add_values, 2, 2, 2, src, src2
    movu  m0, [srcq]
    movu  m1, [src2q]

    paddb m0, m1

    movu  [srcq], m0

    RET
```
