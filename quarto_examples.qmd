This is an example post using quarto markdown syntax..

## Code blocks

Let's start with some code!

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Yo")
}
```

Did you like my code?

## Callouts

::: {.callout-note}
## Note with Title

This is an example of a callout note with a title.

I heard in copywriting they use this technique called "call to action" intermittently to get you to do stuff. It's very effective!


## Charts

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  A[Hard edge] --> B(Round edge)
  B --> C{Decision}
  C --> D[Result one]
  C --> E[Result two]
```

Aren't these charts cool?


## Math formulas

inline math: $E = mc^{2}$
$$E = mc^{2}$$

Doesn't this math look sophisticated?

## Embedded videos

Isn't this an absolute banger?

## Tables

| Right | Left | Default | Center |
|------:|:-----|---------|:------:|
|   12  |  12  |    12   |    12  |
|  123  |  123 |   123   |   123  |
|    1  |    1 |     1   |     1  |

Everyone loves tables right?
